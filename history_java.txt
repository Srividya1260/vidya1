 HISTORY OF JAVA:
 Java was originally designed for interactive television, but it was too 
 advanced technology for the digital  cable television industry at the time. 
 The history of Java starts with the  Green Team. Java team members
 (also known as Green Team), initiated  this project to develop a language
 for digital devices such as set-top boxes, televisions, etc. However, 
 it was best suited for internet programming. Later, Java technology 
 was incorporated by Netscape. Java was developed by James Gosling, who is known 
 as the father of Java, in 1995. James Gosling and his team members started 
 the project in the early '90s.
 James Gosling - founder of java Currently, Java is used in internet programming, 
 mobile devices, games, e-business solutions, etc. Following are given significant 
 points that describe the history of Java.

1) James Gosling, Mike Sheridan, and Patrick Naughton initiated the Java 
    language project in June 1991. The small team of sun engineers called Green 
    Team.

2) Initially it was designed for small, embedded systems in electronic 
    appliances like set-top boxes.

3) Firstly, it was called "Greentalk" by James Gosling, and the file 
    extension was .gt.

4) After that, it was called Oak and was developed as a part of the 
    Green project.

Java virtual machine(JVM):
                                              A Java virtual machine is a virtual machine that 
enables a computer to run Java programs as well as programs written in other 
languages that are also compiled to Java bytecode. The JVM is detailed by a 
specification that formally describes what is required in a JVM implementation.

=>Java Virtual Machine, or JVM, loads, verifies and executes Java bytecode. 
It is known as the interpreter or the core of Java programming language 
because it executes Java programming
