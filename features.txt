Java Features :
1.Object Oriented :  
                              In Java, everything is an Object. Java can be easily 
   extended since it is based on the Object model.

2.Platform Independent : 
                                        Unlike many other programming languages 
   including C and C++, when Java is compiled, it is not compiled into 
   platform specific machine, rather into platform-independent byte code. 
   This byte code is distributed over the web and interpreted by the Virtual 
   Machine (JVM) on whichever platform it is being run on.

3.Simple :
                Java is designed to be easy to learn. If you understand the basic 
   concept of OOP Java, it would be easy to master.

4.Architecture-neutral :
                                   Java compiler generates an architecture-neutral object 
   file format, which makes the compiled code executable on many processors, 
   with the presence of Java runtime system.

5.Portable :
                  It is portable because it allows you to carry the java bytecode to any platform

6.Interpreted :
                       JVM is the java interpreter it can execute java bytecode directly on 
   any machine

7.Multi-threaded :
                            A thread is like a seperate program,executing concurently

8. High-performance :
                                   Java is faster than any other language.Java byte code is similar 
   to native machine code

9.Robust :
                  It means strong . It uses strong memory management.Due to lack of 
  pointers will avoid security problems

9.Distributed :
                       A technology is said to be distributed if its bussiness objects
  are graphically dispersed intlo different locations .

10.Secure :
                   It has no pointers to avoid security problems.It runs inside a virtual
  machine sand box
11.Dynamic :
                       It supports dynamic loading of classes.So called dynamic


**Structure of Java Program :
          Let's see which elements are included in the structure of a Java 
    program. A typical structure of a Java program contains the following 
    elements:  
                     * Documentation Section=>//First Java Program  

                     * Package Declaration=>package Myself;

                      * Import Statements=>import java.util.*;

                      * Interface Section=>interface car  
                                                         {  
                                                              void start();    
                                                         }  

                      * Class Definition=>class Student   
                                                        {  
                                                         }  

                      * Class Variables and Variables=>class Student 
                                                                               {  
                                                                                   String sname;  
                                                                                   int id;   
                                                                                   double percentage;   
                                                                               }  

                       * Main Method Class=>public static void main(String args[])  

                       * Methods and Behaviors =>   public class Demo {  
                                                                         public static void main(String[]args){  
                                                                         void display() {  
                                                                         System.out.println("Welcome to javatpoint");  
                                                                         }  
                                                                         //statements  
                                                                        } }                        
  **Java Variables::
                                A variable is a container which holds the value while 
      the Java program is executed. A variable is assigned with a data type.
 **Types of Variables:
                                 There are three types of variables in Java:
                                 =>local variable:A variable declared inside the body of 
                                      the method is called local variable.

                                 =>instance variable:A variable declared inside the class 
                                     but outside the body of the method, is called an 
                                     instance variable.

                                 =>static variable:A variable that is declared as static 
                                      is called a static variable.
**Primitive Data Types:
                                          A primitive data type specifies the size and type of 
    variable values, and it has no additional methods.

There are eight primitive data types in Java:
                  byte	     1 byte	      Stores whole numbers from -128 to 127
                  short	     2 bytes	      Stores whole numbers from -32,768 to 32,767
                  int	     4 bytes	      Stores whole numbers from -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647
                  long	     8 bytes	      Stores whole numbers from -9,223,372,036,854,775,808 to 9,223,372,036,854,775,807
                  float	     4 bytes	      Stores fractional numbers. Sufficient for storing 6 to 7 decimal digits
                  double	     8 bytes	      Stores fractional numbers. Sufficient for storing 15 decimal digits
                  boolean	     1 bit	      Stores true or false values
                  char           2 bytes           Stores a single character
