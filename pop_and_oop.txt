**differences between procedural language and object oriented programming :

*Procedural language:
                                  It can be defined as a programming model which is derived from 
structured programming, based upon the concept of calling procedure. Procedures, 
also known as routines, subroutines or functions, simply consist of a series of computational 
steps to be carried out. During a programâ€™s execution, any given procedure might be 
called at any point, including by other procedures or itself. ex: cobal,basic and c

*Object oriented programming :
                                               can be defined as a programming model which is based 
upon the concept of objects. Objects contain data in the form of attributes and code in 
the form of methods. In object-oriented programming, computer programs are designed 
using the concept of objects that interact with the real world. Object-oriented programming 
languages are various but the most popular ones are class-based, meaning that objects are 
instances of classes, which also determine their types. ex: java , c++, python


Procedural Oriented Programming	                          Object-Oriented Programming

1. In procedural programming, the program                 1. In object-oriented programming, the 
    is divided into small parts called functions.	         program is divided into small parts 
                                                                                           called objects.

2. Procedural programming follows a                            2. Object-oriented programming follows 
    top-down approach                                                         a bottom-up approach.

3. There is no access specifier in                                   3. Object-oriented programming has access 
     procedural programming.                                             specifiers like private, public, protected, 
                                                                                           etc.

4. Adding new data and functions                                 4. Adding new data and function is easy.
    is not easy.

5. Procedural programming does not                             5.  Object-oriented programming provides 
    have any proper way of hiding data                                 data hiding so it is more secure.
    so it is less secure.

6. In procedural programming,                                      6.  In object-oriented programming, 
    there is no concept of data                                               the concept of data hiding and 
    hiding and inheritance.                                                    inheritance is used.

7. Procedural programming uses                                    7. Object-oriented programming uses 
    the concept of procedure abstraction.                              the concept of data abstraction.

8.  Code reusability absent in                                          8.  Code reusability present in 
      procedural programming,                                               object-oriented programming.
